# Congo
## Welcome to the Congo

This is an AngularJS application with ASP.NET services driving the back-end. Congo is an online shopping
experience with two types of users, admins and customers. Admin users can manage the site's products being sold, and view
orders histories. The customer users are able to browse categories and products, add products to their cart,
browse their past orders, and finish their shopping experience by paying with their credit card.
